# Main window layouts can be configured. You can change the position and the
# size of the menus (directory and playlist). You have 3 layouts and switch
# between then using the 'l' key (standard mapping). By default only 2 layouts
# are configured.
#
# The format is as follows:
# Each menu is described in the format NAME:POSITION_X,POSITION_Y,WIDTH,HEIGHT
# NAME is directory or playlist.
# The other parameters define position and size of the menu. They can be
# absolute numbers (like 10) or a percent value of the screen size (like 45%).
# WIDTH and HEIGHT can have value of FILL which means fill the screen from
# the menu's position to the border.
# Separate menu descriptions using a space.
# Menus may overlap.
# You must describe at least one menu (default is to fill the whole window).
# There must be at least one layout (Layout1) defined. Others can be empty ("").
#
# Examples:
#
# Just one layout, the directory will occupy the whole screen, the playlist
# will have 1/4 of the screen size and be positioned at lower right corner.
Layout1 = "playlist:50%,50%,50%,50%"
# Layout2 = ""
# Layout3 = ""
#
# The screen is split into two parts: playlist at the top and the directory
# menu at the bottom. Playlist will occupy 10 lines and the directory menu
# the rest.
Layout2 = "playlist:0,0,100%,10 directory:0,10,100%,FILL"
#
# Default configuration:
# Layout1        = "directory:0,0,50%,100% playlist:50%,0,50%,100%"
# Layout2        = "directory:0,0,100%,100% playlist:0,0,100%,100%"
